that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death. The film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997 by Toho, and in the 
United States on October 29, 1999. The film greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. The movie is about 
extreme kindness, honesty and fearless spirit.

<h3>Wolf Children</h3>

<h3>Pom Poko</h3>
<pr />
Pom Poko is a 1994 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Isao Takahata, animated by Studio Ghibli.

An environmental allegory, the story features tanuki, or Japanese raccoon dogs (incorrectly referred to as "raccoons" 
in the English dialog). In Japanese folklore, tanuki are considered to be magical creatures, capable of shape-shifting 
into people or other objects. They are a highly sociable, mischievous species, too fun-loving and fond of tasty treats 
to be a real threat – unlike kitsune (foxes) and other shape-shifters. The phrase "Pom Poko" in the title refers to the 
sound of tanuki drumming their bellies, from a 1919 poem by Ujō Noguchi which became a popular children's song.
The story is about love and respect of the nature and live beeings no matter of their species.
